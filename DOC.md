# Built-in data structures

## Variable

## Fixed array
Fixed-size (static) homogeneous (single-type) array.

Syntax:
type#size

C++ equivalent:
std::array


## Dynamic array
Dynamic (resizable), homogeneous (single-type) array.

Syntax:
type#

C++ equivalent:
std::vector

## Dynamic named array
Associative, dynamic (resizable), homogeneous (single-type) array. Keys are of type string.

Syntax:
type#

C++ equivalent:
std::map

## Fixed tuple
Fixed-size (static) heterogeneous (multi-type) tuple.

C++ equivalent:
std::tuple

## Named tuple
Associative, fixed-size (static) heterogeneous (multi-type) tuple.

C++ equivalent:
std::tuple with compile-time defined std::array of names.
